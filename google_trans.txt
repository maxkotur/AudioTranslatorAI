I am Gojko Kotor born with trauma under Kozar for somewhere for 30 years because I don't know exactly for the years since I have been baptized in the monastery the books have all burned me all the killed I have no one and so I know nothing exactly that I know exactly what they are or yearsDate that was so much of us full house to see Stojan Ba Ba Ba Ba Stojno DMITAR DMITAR MILEVA E32 NO I STREET VOJIN AND MY Sister Bank Zapruđe name Ana broke after me and that is every night except in the face of God we have to goIn the corner he turns to the east and praying to God, and then we must not write to you when they are praying to God and so baptized here and in the monastery I was told by one aunt that she wore me in my college who was OK wore andI had a baptized ox we had three horses ended up I was finished Dunja because there weren't all the peaks, but who were faster than the pain we had loved we had three four cows may have two calves if there were a lot of sheep pigs we chased up in the woodsWas there any jury there were chestnuts anything Jana to my jed went up to take it and there and take them a hut and make Vido every night and so will be a week with them and they come to the same place always to lie down here.And so we had we had I think we were eating were my princes so they were and Knezevic chose a little rich people my rich people were pretty rich and so this one and we had a lot of rounds of brni plows what I know dick Neven deliciousAnd now that old one and the curuzi and everything lived, so it was not all lively that gorgeous, but I mean poorly, but it was good for the mostly for the commands fucking anything else, so you hear Kozara even before the war we were full of peoples we lived from Kozara because ofWhat we had cattle and smoked as soon as the spring of the Kuruz had something to do and something then these pains were released all the cows that do not be a muse in the forest there either in the forest or no heifers, and so it was there and there was some slaughter of one's slaughterAnd so, but it didn't bother nobody we lived in Kozara, I am now beautiful to me, my father has shared up in the forest, my father was in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia a soldier, when when Svabo struck in Yugoslavia then Yugoslavia fell apartand my father came from this from the dissolved break or the army was 41 and I found out then that something was wrong but I didn't know what it would be if I wasn't a politician and what I knew if my father was not some of meThe politician was that it was a peasant and what do I know we lived here and what do I know if you livestock and agriculture that war when you began to get up right away here bombardier, but there were a monastery three times but it was someĐoko Savić man's older one called him to come out and when he calculates it how old you are, he was only for the ears of this one here's Mile some Kotura, the same was in Krčedin Radio up came immediately by Sublim, the Ratia had been attacked many times from belowAnd then be Ana Ratkovic I say a woman I remember a little when she started running away and that transition would be killed by this one then this would be there and Sekulic some there is a little further there are all they have killed I say you we were fromMixed with the Croats did not know where to you as much as you could not be able to fall out of that you did not know where you were or what and so that they were killing everything to determine Kentia Bima Selmani this great village, but there are certainly 78 families that no one has dried up so there areThere are a cod of Sekulic Pajic Kasalica this Savic has and you have surnames as in other places, and I don't know I tell you 42 exactly that your options are now nice to corpse or cow or a man or a man or pig or that was so frozen but that is but thatare all the Ustasha Germans killed a little something but not as much as the Ustashas were killed by Pavle will go to Gojko and almost and so that I don't know I survived it all but it is impossible to describe what was doing everything did the Ustashas what they didI better pray to make up whatever I can invent they did there that was 41 after 14 when it was in when Pavelic let the Ustasha go to kill the horse then the people of the depths flee to the Kozar tannery were full of people of livestockThis one made the huts if it was Juli's month of Juna Moon already and I went to me Street was up in the partisans there was a bull's burning staff of the second partisan detachment in me Street was on the border among there he heard the plane of Franjo Kluz and Rudi CajevacWhen they were and I went there if I had a better uncle than my father and my mother went there that we had a visit to some relatives and I went there and came for the first time 40 others that I saw the plane and this one and my uncle iswas the guardian of the plane and thus covered the willow branches later my uncle said to be a dumper and he was the Elijah Backer, but it was an unhappy case inserted that grenade in u djer she went up only 1m studied roming in both knees then then they were thenswitched him to the hospital was a hospital on a concrete e my mother went to see him and I went i will be knocking  It was all a lot of livestock and the people and the people, and it all worked and the Lota was dying there was nothing to say to you it was that it was and maybe a man couldn't even imagine, but again somehow peoples to life and in that KozaraUntil the 42 Princess Division began to go to the Russian Front, but Pavelica begged Hitler that the division came to clean the Kozar from the partisans, then they were this one and before that the Ustashas were plundered there was no thing they did not attack and knives on the knivesThey killed up there are about 15 people one left alive you see what this was the case when they were lined up by Iuda why it was not a cat's gun and then killed it and when I missed the bullet he skipped this to wait for it to waitthat he was his name just his name and everything from Dubica and so that he remained alive saw everything that happened, when I went up to find uncle's up there were the palaces of more wounded and so when we were coming backOP from above we see what was all a lot of people all this one and when I came to you after again, the Ustashas were attacking again, we were attacking we wicked out of here, worse up the army and then but nothing I know but it wasn't enough for this PavelicDid the Pazove 100 km to Zagreb and when they were looking for a shit of a shvab to clean the Kozar, but I go Partizan Schwabs then came and surrounded all the way to Banja Luka all the dawn of Sokola and they went to the tanneWe have a background to kill and what do I know all that is not here in one village this Vlach cim in niche all for the people with wire around the hay and sets on the hay and so that he pulls everything up and to herself, and so now my uncle is left upBut there are two more brothers and they went to the hospital up with him and were and he said the skull I had the Know, come home to bring food to these transient he while they came here, but on Kozari there

for this one to lead this today in the villages so that my family we hear and my cousin is or neighbor that it caught up in to go to Grubišno Polje drove us out there from Grubišno Polje today for one village of Velika Peratovica it was that it wasThe Serbian village name and when we came there to put us in one school and yours were already domestic and partisans, and they thought that we Ercegovci came today, Srpska Serbian houses, Celin, they have proven that we are all up and then and then it will then.The next day the headquarters came to us and then distributed us to the houses of my mother to that house of Baba Vi other what I know they gave me to one but Serb is the same to not Peulic and to me it was good with them you know the Serbs but still everything elseThere was not this one was not right for war i was here and after we after we just some other party with some old men to keep pigs and then just now he was mowed this and that we do that  was always left in the memory of the women, so that was now Avgust is the beginning of Avgusta, and I am this one then I am a woman to keep that and the pigs come in, come in, whether in some one is a little isolated house of two old men there and let's keep guardand I will go the water in the evening in the evening to me the space and this way down to the ground down to lie to her brothers came a cat and constantly cursing my mouth I take that cat and under my feet I run into the stomach in the stomach and go back to my boss again it was earlierThat and so it lasted one for almost a month, then you started off and out there as well as on Kozari then we wicked there the same partisans won the Virovitica there and got one stunt someone and some shoes were given to me by my pussy straw pantalone withoutCepovo and when the offensive began again any worse and there is Bilogora's forest, he says, go to flee we have a boil us to kill us the camp when the skeletal from Propaganda says tomorrow will come to the planes bombard the camp what I can because we go out of any worse in the tower was oneLittle Forest was a Skrljevo Bukvica to be over overgrown with me and settled two women from here with a boy and I would be and I would be my mother's sister and was this grandmother and my mother Marko was that Avgust Moon wantedgoes to bring us water and she has gone to bring water and there is no way I have me and my grandmother went to look for her there corn no matter what I heard exactly when the rifle broke if it was equally Sava we were down and worseThen the rifle broke but we didn't know anything about it tomorrow to come across a shooting machine and how they go yelling or bad for but I don't know what I still don't know what their volleyball is progress on what I and we haven't seen us we were well in the bushes in that butThis one fired a bullet 200 wakes up any 3 children here for two years began to cry he says he says who is down to me if we are now in that pit that a woman tells her women and the kids needs anything and hide from the artillery water you think of grenade says haraYou go out to eat a creature that he says there is that he's encountered escapes a woman and the kids throw a bomb to the facility, whatever they let Mick to the mother's cunt, what let us go now are now collecting from all sides at one house Nenna Brdašce here thisIt's like your own now's acceptable camp I thought and found your uterus and find nothing and this from mobil four days, and this one and women have been a lot of here let's look for at Kuruz there is mine there is my aunt she goes with meLooking for there when there will be a Bosnian woman here, then she then what I know and when we went where he was right there and kept Djordje to find my mother dead, exactly in the forehead, the worms had already begun to begin the moon that this one had already shot my head exactly exactlyin the head and I found that he hit if they were then the cocolate and this one with a cave and shoes that shoes shoes to exactly how she fell on her back knew how to hit her watched if she was carrot or not and so now says bound that isIt is a late night before saying we will leave tomorrow we have no chest, but it means some of the ways of salary, so they will wrap Sarao not a blunt they have not greeted you a lot of youth and a little hug and then I just knew 45 and what was the dogs cameThey dug so that she ate that herself to say that I went to I found myself aj, whose and all and all this and this one and this day, in our Church, called Holy Friday I know exactly, and they start from the door, they would less start killing the warehouses if we werewas a full church, but when these began to go to the horse and kill us only one expense was whether there was a climb each other now a domestic partisan, and these came today from him if they were going to their family but the Ustasha were there and were and there wereI know one woman from here he leaned the rifle there in the vineyard there this partisan path with hence this here in, what are the budgets now, but so I concluded later if they killed us the night already saved then he can't go to Grubišno Field Grubišnofield 9 km you know I can't go out if they killed us and then this one brought us and for the Grubišno field I would come at night there in the devil's mother has some shoes to the class, and then beat us with those claws or for livestock or if someone fallsThere is no one and that he is lifted or something just a fairy tale from above and leaves it and so when we came to Grubišno Polje we came to school you know the Ustashas then they picked us up the children and no longer asked how old there was only if you see that a littleGrowing up this one immediately bought and the day before that I may have swallowed that when he was there, Peratovica was swallowing him and he didn't even get all the money because he told me one who escaped from the same money that he came and he forgot thatBut now and the Ustasha my neighbor my neighbor and I had the same one of my peers there are two of us Milovan Kotur and I this one, so my grandmother and his mother covered us a little over the funeral today does not see the marshrhome of the Ustashas to take us to say what it isThis typhus then was typhus fuck him and they went there they picked up everything if there was a needle of the scissors all of us picked up this one and then and then nothing else about  I don't see anything account we were here and for about three days come again the composition of the train and the need for all that was and part of all women girls children were everything and everything and teraj we went down for three days we went down if you knew how you had toare missing this army, so at each almost station I can stop missing the army and where we have traveled for three days or the water has nothing to come in in the fall the money stands and left the composition and he says no more piss whether it was his signThat there was no longer room there was no more room in the fall sheep, but they are still there for the state for two days you know to her as much as the girl's girlfriend women's children old old grandmothers with it all this and it stinks no one and no one opens this barngood night and one night that the praise of the start of the compositions began to go on to go by I go by I watch Kozar Fuck you will shoot us here and we come to Sisak when we came to Sisak unloaded us on the open railway there is nothing and the cells are nothing and then us and then usPick up there and come on the haircut of a woman fucking old women and come upstairs and all the good today was not important to the kids this one and so that the shedgehog now tells us, come on the mater's goods there was a boiler room so that it is evaporated and so on and soI want you to not find yours and then the next day we find it what we are in training and so and in that we are here and the rest of us have not yet loved it came that I think that some about 7,000 parts of there went so at least one about me about me about meAnd then we stay here I can eat the same you don't have God knows what and there was a corn that number, but it was a fucking glass you reconcile your anus now me and my cousin we are not so what will I take it and make you a little soup of circularflour and so this one continuing the women were women were separated by this one those had a camp second of us were not masonry and we were just this barracks and any straw children were there for a month and what I know and dear butThe highest until 1:50 mA was not even until 12 years fuck it and then every day the three let the women come to the children and in the morning and that was left in the third when they open the gate they do not fly to look for their child thereyour died of someone else's still live what I know and then at noon and in the evening, and so it was some with me I lie down just feel that it is icy and almost this one was some Marko he was also narrower, but I have to beSlavonian boldly would be a little me and one morning when he died now you don't have to die come every morning what's a dead car but these were not a dead car that was Plato Plato Plato who dragged the horses and then whoever died something I throw upAnd the teraj and there was already a dug hole and threw in that hole from the top of the shot on the occasion and so we finish which one it was, so you don't have to die, but only if you see you the charger to put on my sister with me with my sisterTo me she was younger that she got sick of eating from and I had to get up every in the morning before they come they did not know how to come at 8:00, what do I know nothing Deezer September Oktobar I don't even know I will have to take her for a barrack thereto squat and that one is looking for the resulting has a dead one something and when I get there I say what to do with the emergency you know, I will have to and so I saved it that it was not that he had not stacked one day some cigVamo bags on the tap and the prince tells you I am Dunja Dunja Fuck you well, but says that you will suffer that tomorrow I will bring you clooney say the bread and the next day he came to the bag over the wire of the Ustasha from above to the shotgun take the sack of the abysss we return norgood good nothing then I started me and that my cousin Milovan started to try what under the wire under the wire I go to the fields that was already autumn we are almost there if you find half a tomato slapping him half a half pepper or something whateverYou find it welcome to us Bio you will take it and so when the parts saw that we go to go to the children with us do what you don't have to go to the day and go at midnight and then we retire there and I come there.Inside and light and we crossed some dogs, some dog came to me, I found a trap rehearsal, I didn't even know what you were not a clan from the center as you say, but I don't suffer my full bosom me when I drew the full bush of that and I and Milovan PastranI loved I took it and let go and we didn't bother to go mother anymore and so we were one woman brought one hleb as she managed I don't know and this one when they gave me we are that on the square but not even whenI will all you but I guess and this is where I start to die, they are uniting the dying one thing else that the others are suffering, and so that the barracks were just straw there was there and I always leave every woman for the children to the floor I interpret it nor that little oneWhat the time comes to says women who have children and children who will let the mother come for a pass we will go home and I could go home, but I didn't even know where I knew I was a sign of a long way and godmother admittedly there and now since I don't have mothersmy sister has no mother and  There was another Mikan Misser and his sister, and they didn't have the same to take us aunts and what the throttle of the Serbs take us aunt as their children to go to her, you are not young children, two of them pass the idea of passing me an Anka Catholic Serbia whencame to the gate when these were not

thereThe main thing did not fail after the war, the same with this broom in the same basket as the Croats here were immediately taxes to pay like them there that they robbed us were women from here to know there and cows and pain have some ours were one cow that wasthey ran away did not have the Ustashas and the whole village with milk young and again and again who did not let us go to the church
